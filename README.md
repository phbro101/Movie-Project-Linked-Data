# DKE 2020 Home Project

This repository contains the home project for the Data and Knowledge Engineering class 2020 at Heinrich Heine University.


## Topic: Linked Data Modeling, Retrieval, and Integration

This home project exercise can be completed at home, using the expertise and skill sets acquired in the DKE 2020 lectures. All students are invited to present solutions in the exercises for grade improvement. Use this repository to prepare your solution. 

## Time Line

Provide the source code and generated output by __12.06.2020__, __21:00__ o'clock CET time zone. Present your solution (approach, results) to the class during the DKE2020 lecture on __23.06.2020__ (detailed arrangements about presentations will be announced later in the lecture)


## Folder Structure

The __assignment__ folder contains the input data, details on the home project, and the information which packages for Python 3 that are needed to complete the assignment.
- __input_data__: contains the CSV file comprising 250 movies with their title, director name, and publication date
- __notebooks__: contains three notebooks for the 3 tasks including detailed information on each task
  - _example.ipynb_ comprises the example code for retreiving famous scientists from DBpedia explained in the lecture 
- __src__: empty python package that can be used for python files containing code for the home project
- __output_data__: empty folder that must be populated with the results of the home project. Detailed instructions on how to produce the output data is comprised in the notebooks with the task description.
  - _example_outputdata.n3_ comprises the retrieved RDF triple in N3 serialization from the example query explained in the lecture
  - _example_output_application.html_ defines the resulted toy web application explained in the lecture
- __environment.yml__: contains the libraries that are needed to complete the home project.

To complete the home project, you can populate the notebooks or use the src folder for your python files.

## Submission

Submitting a correct solution on time that fulfills the needed requirements will result in a __0.3 grade improvement__ in the final exam. Presentation of results is mandatory.
